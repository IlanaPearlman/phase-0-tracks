# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows users to view the history of revisions the file(s) in a project and merge the revisions made by any number of people.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is the duplication of a project to allow modifications in parallel, and it also allows the development of features separately from a stable master branch
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is when the changes in the staged files are tracked. A good commit message explains the change made.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when git cannot automatically merge the branches due to inconsistent changes, so that a person has to decide what changes should be made.
