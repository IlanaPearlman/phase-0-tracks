        <li> Mozzarella cheese is fermented milk, generally of of buffalo or cattle. </li>
        <li> Dinosaurs and hunter-gatherer humans did not have regular access to such dairy products. </li>
        <li> So if you are Paleo, pizza is forbidden! </li>
      </ul>
      <li> The Paleo diet consists of eating the vegetables, meats, and fishes of ancient pre-agricultural times, and forbids grains, sugars, dairy, and cheetos. <em> NO CHEETOS!!! </em></li>
